          The average person collects dozens, if not hundreds, of business cards
          throughout their career. With so many cards, it can be tough to keep
          track of them all â€“ and even tougher to find the one you need when you
          need it.

          keep track of your contacts and find the information you need when you
          need it.

          What sets us apart from other digital business card services is our
          use of Near Field Communication (NFC) tags. With an NFC-enabled
          device, such as a smartphone, you can simply tap your card on the
          front or back camera of your device to automatically add the contact
          to your address book. To learn more about how to use our service, read
          on!
