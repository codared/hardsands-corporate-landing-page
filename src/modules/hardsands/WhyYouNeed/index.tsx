          Unlimited sharing

        <Text mb={6}>
          Digital business cards are an important tool for modern businesses.
          They allow you to share your contact information with others quickly
          and easily, providing several features, and benefits that traditional
          paper business cards can&apos;t match
        </Text>
        <Text mb={6}>
          One of the most important advantages of digital business cards is that
          they can be easily shared with others. With a traditional paper
          business card, you can only give someone your card if they are with
          you at the time.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={6}>
          But with a digital card, you can share your card with anyone, anytime,
          anywhere. All they need is an internet connection, and they can view
          your Hardsands card and all of your contact information.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={6}>
          This unlimited sharing is a major advantage of digital business cards
          and can help you promote your business and build your network more
